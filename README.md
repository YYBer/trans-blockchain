This is the solidity part of the game project.


After each game, the game data is read from the backend, deposited on eth sepolia via smart contract, and the transaction is stored in the database for dashboard queries.


I use docker, postgres, django, and solidity.


For the whole project please see: https://github.com/mvomiero/42_pong
